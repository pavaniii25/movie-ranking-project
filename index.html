 <h1>The best movies according to Pavani!</h1>
 <h2>My top 4 movies of all time:</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Luca</h3>
 <p>One of my favourite disney movies. Loved the plot- cheerful, exciting and overall a fun disney film.</p>
 <h3>The darjeeling limited</h3>
 <p>My first Wes Anderson film which was quite good.Took me a while to uderstand what the movie was tryna say. Calming, relaxing and loved the Satyajit Ray's movies' ost used in here. Could've given Irfhan Khan a better and a bigger role :(</p>
 <h3>Forgotten</h3>
 <p>Kang Haneul's acting was amazingg. Plot was undeniably neat and good. Plot twists were unexpected.</p>
 <h3>Aanandha purathu veedu</h3>
 <p>Nostalgic childhood film. Reminds me of my late grandparents every goddamn time I rewatch this movie. Never fails to make me cry.</p>
